Experiments in using our existing CUSUM metholdogy to discover organisations that are quick to change

This repo supports further investigations into opioid prescribing following the Public Health England Prescribed Medicines Review. Full deatils on the background and another approach taken can be seen in the [repo where we have implemented the OpenPrescribing Change Detection python library](https://github.com/ebmdatalab/opioids-change-detection-notebook/) on opioid measures.

## How to view the notebooks

Notebooks live in the `notebooks/` folder (with an `ipynb`
extension). You can most easily view them [on
nbviewer](https://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/ebmdatalab/cusum-for-opioids-notebook/tree/master/notebooks/),
though looking at them in Github should also work.

You can view *and interact* with any notebooks in the `notebooks/`
folder by launching the notebook in the free online service,
[![Binder](https://mybinder.org/badge_logo.svg)](https://mybinder.org/v2/gh/ebmdatalab/cusum-for-opioids-notebook/master).

Any changes you make there won't be saved; to do development work,
you'll need to set up a local jupyter server and git repository - see
`DEVELOPERS.md` for more detail.
